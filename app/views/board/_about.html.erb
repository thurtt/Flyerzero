		<h1>What is Flyer Zero?</h1>
		<img src="/assets/flyer_example.png" />
		<p>
		    Flyer Zero is designed to change the way people find and promote local events. We feel that printed flyers and handbills are works of
		    art that capture the 'feel' of an event. Flyer Zero combines the artistry of flyers with the power of social networks to create a
		    completely new experience.

		and you're ready to go.

		<h1>Flyer making tips!</h1>
		<p>We've seen a lot of flyers, both good and bad, at Flyer Zero. Keep going to see some tips to make better flyers, especially for Flyer Zero. :)</p>

		<h1>Wall of Text</h1>
		<p>Don't do it. I know you have a lot to say, but say it graphically. Keep it short and sweet. Not only will people pay more attention to it,
		but you'll also have more room for your imagery.</p>
	    </div>

	    <div class="step slide" data-x="2250" data-y="-500" data-z="-3550">
		<h1>Font Size</h1>
		<p>Be smart. Keep the important stuff large enough to read at a distance or as a thumbnail. Important stuff is different from flyer to flyer,
		but things like band names, venue names, and dates are pretty good bets.</p>
	    </div>

	    <div class="step slide" data-x="2250" data-y="-500" data-z="-5050">
		<h1>Upload Size</h1>
		<p>If you're promoting online (like Flyer Zero, yeah!) you need to upload larger images. They don't have to be print-size, but they definitely shouldn't be thumbnails.
		Flyer Zero will make all the varied sizes it needs from your image, so give us something larger if you have it.</p>
	    </div>

	    <div class="step slide" data-x="2250" data-y="-500" data-z="-7550">
		<h1>Media</h1>
		<p>Include media if you can. Youtube videos of previous performances, sound cloud clips, reverbnation clips, or movie trailers are good candidates.
		Maybe you have more ideas? Flyer Zero will lets you include many different types of media to add a little something extra to your flyer.</p>
